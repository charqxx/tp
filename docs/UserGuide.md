## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for CareerConnect.

1. Open a command terminal, type `cd [filepath]` into the folder you put the jar file in. You can find the correct filepath by right-clicking on the folder and selecting _Copy as path_.

1. Type in `java -jar CareerConnect.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `viewall` : Lists all recruiters.

    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com o/NUS` : Adds a recruiter named `John Doe` to CareerConnect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `viewall`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you receive an **_Invalid command format!_** message, please check your input format against the given example in the output window.
  * Can always type `help` to refer back  to this guide.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Exiting the program : `exit`

### Saving the data

CareerConnect data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

CareerConnect data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, CareerConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause CareerConnect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CareerConnect home folder.

**Q**: I edited the data file and now something is wrong with the application. What do I do?<br>
**A**: To reset the application, go to the folder containing the jar file and find the data subfolder. From there, delete the file addressbook.json and re-open the application. Unfortunately, any existing data will be gone.

**Q**: Can I use non-English names or tags?<br>
**A**: No, currently only English letters, numbers, and certain special characters are supported. Non-English characters (e.g., Chinese, Arabic, accented letters) are not allowed.

**Q**: Why does sorting names sometimes seem unpredictable when they contain numbers or special characters?<br>
**A**: The sort name order is based on the ASCII values of characters. As a result, names with numbers or special characters may not appear in strict alphabetical order.

**Q**: Why did `addtag` or `filtertag` reject my input with "Invalid tag detected"? <br>
**A**: CareerConnect only accepts **alphanumeric tags**. Tags can contain letters and digits, but no special symbols such as `@`, `#`, `_`, or spaces. For example, `t/SoftwareEngineer` is valid, but `t/software_engineer` or `t/@swe` is not.

**Q**: Why are some commands case-sensitive and others case-insensitive? <br>
**A**: CareerConnect is designed to be as flexible as possible for its users. While exact duplicates are not allowed to avoid confusion, visibly different names or tags (case-sensitive) are therefore permitted. Hence, any command that uses these values (`pin`, `edit`, `delete` etc.) are also case-sensitive.
On the other hand, any `find` and `filter` commands are case-insensitive so that users don't have to remember the exact capitalisation of a contact to find it, greatly improving ease of use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Tag limitations:** Tags must be strictly **alphanumeric**. Characters such as `_`, `@`, or `-` are not accepted. <br>
   **Workaround:** Replace them with simple letters or numbers (e.g., `softwareengineer`).
4. The tag distribution dashboard window plays a refresh animation even if no new tag has been added. Note that this is a purely cosmetic issue and has no impact on functionality.
